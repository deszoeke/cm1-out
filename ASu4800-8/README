ASu4800-8

EKAMSAT Arabian Sea case using June 17 2023 sounding.
1024 x 512
10 degree N
Simplified sounding, linearly interpolating from 1200-7200 m.

ASu4800-8 adds U=8 m/s wind point at 4800 m to the initial sounding, 
interpolating nearby levels and providing a reduced-shear case.

This is a wind shear experiment corresponding to control case ASspinup20230617.
